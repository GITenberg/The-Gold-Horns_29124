5</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Early in the present year Mr. Thos. J. Wise discovered among
the miscellaneous MSS. of Borrow a fragment which proved to be
part of a version of Oehlenschl&auml;ger&rsquo;s <i>Gold
Horns</i>.&nbsp; His attention being drawn to the fact, hitherto
unknown, that Borrow had translated this famous poem, he sought
for, and presently found, a complete MS. of the poem, and from
this copy the present text has been printed.&nbsp; The paper on
which it is written is watermarked 1824, and it is probable that
the version was composed in 1826.&nbsp; The hand-writing
coincides with that of several of the pieces included in the
<i>Romantic Ballads</i> of that year, and there can be little
doubt that Borrow intended <i>The Gold Horns</i> for that volume,
and rejected it at last.&nbsp; He was conscious, perhaps, that
his hand had lacked the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>skill needful to reproduce a lyric the
melody of which would have taxed the powers of Coleridge or of
Shelley.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his attempt seems worthy of
preservation.</p>
<p><i>The Gold Horns</i> marks one of the most important stages
in the history of Scandinavian literature.&nbsp; It is the
earliest, and the freshest, specimen of the Romantic Revival in
its definite form.&nbsp; In this way, it takes in Danish poetry a
place analogous to that taken by <i>The Ancient Mariner</i> in
English poetry.</p>
<p>The story of the events which led to the composition of <i>The
Gold Horns</i> is told independently, by Steffens and by
Oehlenschl&auml;ger in their respective Memoirs, and the two
accounts tally completely.&nbsp; Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl&auml;ger
(1779&ndash;1850), the greatest poet whom the North of Europe has
produced, had already attracted considerable renown and even
profit by his writings, which were in the classico-sentimental
manner of the late 18th century, when, in the summer of 1802, the
young Norwegian philosopher, Henrik Steffens, arrived in
Copenhagen from Germany, where he had imbibed the new romantic
ideas.&nbsp; He began to give lectures on <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&aelig;sthetics, and these awakened a turmoil of
opposition.&nbsp; Among those who heard him, no one was more
scandalised than Oehlenschl&auml;ger, then in his twenty-third
year.&nbsp; He was not acquainted with Steffens, but in the
course of the autumn they happened to meet at a restaurant in
Copenhagen, when they instantly experienced a violent mutual
attraction.&nbsp; Steffens has described how deep an impression
was made upon him by the handsome head, flashing eyes, and
graceful vivacity of the poet, while Oehlenschl&auml;ger bears
witness to being no less fascinated by the gravity and enthusiasm
of the philosopher.&nbsp; The new friends found it impossible to
part, and sixteen hours had gone by, and 3 a.m. had struck,
before Oehlenschl&auml;ger could tear himself away from the
company of Steffens.</p>
<p>He scarcely slept that night, and rose in a condition of
bewilderment and rapture.&nbsp; His first act, after breakfast,
was to destroy a whole volume of his own MS. poetry, which was
ready for press, and for which a publisher had promised him a
handsome sum of money.&nbsp; His next was to sit down and write
<i>The Gold Horns</i>, a manifesto <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of his complete
conversion to the principles of romanticism.&nbsp; Later in the
day he presented himself again at Steffens&rsquo; lodgings,
bringing the lyric with him, &ldquo;to prove,&rdquo; as he says,
&ldquo;to Steffens that I was a poet at last beyond all doubt or
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; His new friend received him with solemn
exultation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now you are indeed a poet,&rdquo; he
said, and folded him in his arms.&nbsp; The conversion of
Oehlenschl&auml;ger to romanticism meant the conquest of Danish
literature by the new order of thought.</p>
<p>Oehlenschl&auml;ger has explained what it was that suggested
to him the leading idea of his poem.&nbsp; Two antique horns of
gold, discovered some time before in the bogs of Slesvig, had
been recently stolen from the national collection at Rosenborg,
and the thieves had melted down the inestimable treasures.&nbsp;
Oehlenschl&auml;ger treats these horns as the reward for genuine
antiquarian enthusiasm, shown in a sincere and tender passion for
the ancient relics of Scandinavian history.&nbsp; From a
generation unworthy to appreciate them, the <i>Horns</i> had been
withdrawn, to be mysteriously restored at the due romantic
hour.&nbsp; He was, when he came under <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the influence
of Steffens, absolutely ripe for conversion, filled with the
results of his Icelandic studies, and with an imagination
redolent of <i>Edda</i> and the Sagas.&nbsp; To this inflammable
material, Henrik Steffens merely laid the torch of his
intelligence.</p>
<p>It is impossible to pretend that Borrow has caught the
enchanting beauty and delicacy of the Danish poem.&nbsp; But he
has made a gallant effort to reproduce the form and language of
Oehlenschl&auml;ger, and we have thought it not without interest
to print opposite his version the whole of the original
Danish.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
